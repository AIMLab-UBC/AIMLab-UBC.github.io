  desc: "I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Iran in 2000, the M.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran polytechnic), Iran in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia, Canada in 2007. I am currently the Director of artificial intelligence (AI) Research in the Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OVCARE) of the BC Cancer/UBC as well as a faculty member in the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and the School of Biomedical Engineering (SBME). My research area lies at the interface between computational, engineering and biomedical sciences. I am interested in developing AI/machine learning, statistical and signal processing algorithms and software infrastructure to combine various sources of omics and imaging data with major emphasis on genomics and digital pathology in cancer."
