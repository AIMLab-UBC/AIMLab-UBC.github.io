I"V<p>As part of the work of the <a href="http://pancancer.info/variant_calling.html">Pancancer variant-calling working
group</a>, we needed to merge the
results of variant calls from a wide range of different packages to compare
their results and select interesting sites for lab validation.  This is a 
more subtle procedure than it sounds, and we could not find any one 
place where all the necessary information was documented, so we wrote up 
our process here.  Code that implements this part of our analysis pipeline
can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/mergevcf">GitHub</a>.</p>
