I"D<p>Last week, <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/">Titus Brown</a> asked a question on <a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown/status/599220862311469056">twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/1002">github</a> which spurred a lot of discussion – what was the best way to randomly read a subset of entries in a FASTQ file?  He and others quickly mentioned the two basic approaches – randomly seeking around in the file, and streaming the file through and selecting at random – and there were discussions of the merits of each in both forums.</p>
