<p>Here at the Simpsonlab we work with signal-level data from nanopore
sequencers, particularly those from ONT like the MinION.  Signal-level
data looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kdtreemapping/squiggle.png" alt="Idealized Example Squiggle Plot" /></p>

<p>where the data comes in as a stream of events (the red lines) with
means, standard deviations, and durations, with each black point
being an individual signal reading.  We use the signal-level data
partly for accuracy - because converting each red line and dozens
of black points into one of four letters invariably loses lots
of information - and partly because those basecalls might not be
available in, say, the field, where the portability of the nanopore
sequencers really shines.</p>

<p>This data has to be interpreted in terms of a particular model of
the interaction of the pore and the strand of DNA; such a pore model
gives, amongst other things, an expected signal mean and standard
deviation for currents through the pore when a given <script type="math/tex">k</script>mer is in
the pore (for the MinION devices, pore models typically use <script type="math/tex">k</script>=5 or
6).  So a pore model might be, for <script type="math/tex">k</script>=5, a table with 1024 entries
that looks something like this:</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-post">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>kmer</th>
      <th>mean</th>
      <th>std dev</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AAAAA</td>
      <td>70.24</td>
      <td>¬± 0.95 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AAAAC</td>
      <td>66.13</td>
      <td>¬± 0.75 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AAAAG</td>
      <td>70.23</td>
      <td>¬± 0.76 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AAAAT</td>
      <td>69.25</td>
      <td>¬± 0.68 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>‚Ä¶</td>
      <td>‚Ä¶</td>
      <td>‚Ä¶</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>and using such a pore model it‚Äôs fairly straightforward to
go from a sequence to an expected set of signal levels from the
sequencer: so, say, for the 10-base sequence AAAAACGTCC and the
above 5-mer pore model we‚Äôd expect 6 events (10-5+1) that look like:</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-post">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>event</th>
      <th>kmer</th>
      <th>mean</th>
      <th>range (1<script type="math/tex">\sigma</script>)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>e1</em></td>
      <td>AAAAA</td>
      <td>70.2 pA</td>
      <td>69.3 -  71.2 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>e2</em></td>
      <td>AAAAC</td>
      <td>66.1 pA</td>
      <td>65.4 -  66.9 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>e3</em></td>
      <td>AAACG</td>
      <td>62.8 pA</td>
      <td>62.0 -  63.6 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>e4</em></td>
      <td>AACGT</td>
      <td>67.6 pA</td>
      <td>66.3 -  68.9 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>e5</em></td>
      <td>ACGTC</td>
      <td>56.6 pA</td>
      <td>54.5 -  58.7 pA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>e6</em></td>
      <td>CGTCC</td>
      <td>49.9 pA</td>
      <td>49.1 -  50.7 pA</td>
    </tr>

<p>Using those models, plus HMMs and a tonne of math, Jared‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/jts/nanopolish">nanopolish</a> tool has had enormous
success improving the quality of nanopore reads and assemblies of
nanopore data.  As one can see from the ‚Äòrange‚Äô column above, and
from the histogram on the side of the first plot, which shows the
numbers of kmers which fall into 1pA bins in the pore model, this
isn‚Äôt necessarily particularly easy.  There are over 70 kmers which
are expected to have means in the range 69.5pA¬†-¬†70.5pA;
that plus the wide standard deviations means that there is enormous
ambiguity going back from signal levels to sequence.</p>

<h3 id="mapping">Mapping</h3>

<p>This ambiguity introduces complication into another part of the
bioinformatics pipeline - mapping.  While several mappers (BWA MEM,
LAST) work quite well with basecalled ONT data, and one mapper<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
has been written specifically for basecalled ONT data, mapping
signal-level data directly is a little tougher.  It is one thing
for a seed sequence in the read to occur in multiple locations in
the reference index; it is another thing for a sequence of
floating-point currents to plausibly represent one of hundreds of
seed sequences.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a flurry of recent important papers and software<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, the first of which are discussed in some informative
<a href="http://robpatro.com/blog/?p=248">blog</a>
<a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/what-is-a-read-mapping/">posts</a>,
have demonstrated the usefulness of approximate read mapping.  In
our case, mapping to an approximate region of a reference would
allow exact but computationally expensive methods like <code class="highlighter-rouge">nanopolish
eventalign</code> to produce precise alignments, or simple assignment may
be all that is necessary for other applications.</p>

<p>So an output approximate mapping would be valuable, but the issues
remains of how to disambiguate the signal level values.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-indexing">Spatial Indexing</h3>

<p>Importantly, while any individual event is very difficult to assign
with precision, sequences of events are less ambiguous, as any given
event is followed, with high probability, by one of only four other
events.  Thus, by examining tuples of events, one can greatly
increase specificity.</p>

<p>And there are well-developed sets of techniques for looking up lists
of <script type="math/tex">d</script> floating point values to look for candidate matches: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_database">spatial
indexes</a>, where
each query or match is considered as a point in <script type="math/tex">d</script>-dimensional
space, and the goal is to return either some number of nearest
points (k-Nearest-Neighbours, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">kNN queries</a>), or
all matches within some, typically euclidean, distance.</p>

<p>To see how this would work, consider indexing the sequence above,
AAAAACGTCC, in a spatial index with <script type="math/tex">d=2</script>.  There are a total of 6
events, so we‚Äôd have 5 points (6-2+1), each points in 2-dimensional
space; 4 are plotted below (the other falls out of the range of the
plot)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kdtreemapping/2d-spatial-query.png" alt="2D Spatial Query" style="width: 478px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" /></p>

<p>and a query for <script type="math/tex">d</script> read events that could be matched by (69.5, 67), the blue point, would return the nearest match (70.2, 66.1) corresponding to the <script type="math/tex">k+d-1</script>-mer AAAAAC.</p>

<p>So to map event data, one can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generate an index:
    <ul>
      <li>Generate all overlapping tuples of <script type="math/tex">d</script> kmers from a reference</li>
      <li>Using a pore model, convert those into points in <script type="math/tex">d</script>-space</li>
      <li>Create a spatial index of those points,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For every read:
    <ul>
      <li>Take every overlapping set of <script type="math/tex">d</script> events</li>
      <li>Look it up in a spatial index</li>
      <li>Find a most likely starting point for the read in the reference, with a quality score.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that one has to explicitly index both the forward and reverse
strands of the reference, since you don‚Äôt <em>a priori</em> know
what the ‚Äúreverse complement‚Äù of 65.5¬†pA is.  One
also has to generate multiple indices; for 2D ONT reads, there is
a pore model for the template strand of a read, and typically two
possible models to choose from for the complement strand of a read,
so one needs three indexes in total to query.</p>

<h3 id="what-dimension-to-choose">What dimension to choose?</h3>

<p>To test this approach, you have to choose a <script type="math/tex">d</script> to use.  On the one
hand, you would like to choose as large a dimension as you can; the
larger <script type="math/tex">k+d-1</script> is, the more unique each seed is and the fewer places
it will occur in any reference sequence.</p>

<p>On the other hand, two quite different constraints put a strong upper limit on the dimensions that will be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a> -
in high spatial dimensions, nearest-neighbour searching is extremely
inefficient, because distance loses its discriminative power.  (Most
things are roughly equally far from each other in 100-dimensional
space; there are a lot of routes you can take!)  As a practical
matter, for most spatial index implementations, for <script type="math/tex">d > 15-20</script> or
so you might as well just do a linear search over all possible
items;</li>
  <li>Current approaches to segmentation mean that ONT data has very
frequent ‚Äòstops‚Äô and ‚Äòskips‚Äô - that is,
events are spuriously either inserted or deleted from the data.
Exactly as with noisy basecalled sequences, this strongly limits
the length of sequence that can be usefully used as seeds.  As we
see below for one set of <em>E. coli</em> data, there is probably not much
point in using <script type="math/tex">d \ge 10</script> even for template-strand data, as the
median ‚Äúdmer‚Äù will have an insertion/deletion in it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/kdtreemapping/events-per-stopskip.png" alt="Distribution of lengths of continuous move events" style="width: 550px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" /></p>

<p>For these two reasons, we‚Äôve been playing with <script type="math/tex">d \approx
8</script>.  I‚Äôll note that while increasing <script type="math/tex">d</script> is the most obvious
knob to turn to increase specificity of the match, higher <script type="math/tex">k</script>
helps as well.</p>

<h3 id="normalizing-the-signal-levels">Normalizing the signal levels</h3>

<p>One issue we haven‚Äôt mentioned is that the raw nanopore data needs
calibration to be compared to the model; there is an additive shift and drift over time,
and a multiplicative scale that has to be taken into account.</p>

<p>A very simple ‚Äúmethods of moments‚Äù calculation works
surprisingly well for long-enough reads, certainly well enough to
start an iterative process; for any given model one is trying to
fit a read to, rescaling the mean and standard deviation of read
events to model events gives a good starting point for calibration,
and drift is initially ignored.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kdtreemapping/initial-rescale.png" alt="Simple initial rescaling of current values by method of moments" /></p>

<h3 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h3>

<p>A simple proof of concept of using spatial indexing to approximately map squiggle data can be found <a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/simple-squiggle-pseudomapper">on github</a>.  It‚Äôs written in python, and has <code class="highlighter-rouge">scipy</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">h5py</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code> as dependencies.  Note that as implemented, it is absurdly memory-hungry, and definitely requires a numpy and scipy built against a good BLAS implementation.</p>

<p>As a spatial index, it uses a version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">k-d tree</a> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">scipy.spatial.cKDTree</code>), which is a very versatile and widely used (and so well-optimized) spatial index widely used in machine learning methods amongst others; different structures may have advantages for this application.</p>

<p>Running the <code class="highlighter-rouge">index-and-map.sh</code> script generates an index for the provided <code class="highlighter-rouge">ecoli.fa</code> reference - about 1 minute per pore model - and then maps the 10 reads provided of both older 5mer and newer 6mer MAP data.  Mapping each read takes about 6 seconds per read per pore model; this involves lots of python list manipulations so could fairly straightforwardly be made much faster.<br />
Doing the simplest thing possible for mapping works surprisingly well.  Using the same sort of approach as the first steps of the Sovic <em>et al.</em> method<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, we just:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the default k-d tree parameters (which almost certainly isn‚Äôt right, particularly the distance measure)</li>
  <li>Consider overlapping bins of starting positions on the reference, of size ~10,000 events, a typical read size</li>
  <li>For each <script type="math/tex">d</script>-point in the read,
    <ul>
      <li>Take the closest match to each <script type="math/tex">d</script>-point (or all within some distance)</li>
      <li>For each match, add a score to the bin corresponding to the implied starting position of the read on the reference; a higher score for a closer match</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Report the best match starting point</li>
</ul>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at the initial output for the older SQK005 ecoli data and newer SQK006 data:</p>

<p>We see a couple of things here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding the complement strand does almost nothing for the accuracy,
but requires substantially more memory and compute time, as multiple
indices must be loaded and used up, and all candidate complement
indices must be compared against each other.  Because of this and
the typically higher skip/stay rates for complement strands, we will use the template
strand only for the rest of this post;</li>
  <li>Since we are simply assigning starting bins at this point, 
any assignments within the bin size are equally accurate; here, all
of the reads were correctly assigned to the starting bin or the neighbouring one.</li>
  <li>The newer 6mer data gives slightly better results; part of this
is likely because we are using the same <script type="math/tex">d</script>, so a dmer for the k=6 data
corresponds to seed longer by one</li>
  <li>The zscore here is a very crude measure of how much the assignment
stands out over the background (but not necessarily how it compares
to other candidate mappings); some of these very simple pseudo-mappings 
are relatively securely identified, and others less so.  The sum-of-scores for
the reads with the best and worst zscore results are plotted below; no prize for
guessing which is which:</li>
</ul>

<p>Because many levels are clustered near ~60-70pA, many dmers are quite
close to each other, and choosing simply the closest <script type="math/tex">d</script>-point is unlikely
to give a robust result.  Examining all possible matches in the spatial
index within some given radius reduces the noise somewhat, at a modest
increase in compute time:</p>

<p>With a few other tweaks - keeping track of the top 10 candidates,
and for each re-testing by recalibrating given the inferred mapping
and rescoring - we can get about 95%-99% accuracy in mapping.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kdtreemapping/dotplot.png" alt="kd-tree approximate mapping vs BWA MEM mapping positions" /></p>

<p>Of course, while 95-99% (Q13-Q20) mapping accuracy on <em>E. coli</em> is
a cute outcome from such a simple approach, it isn‚Äôt nearly
enough; with <script type="math/tex">d=8</script> and <script type="math/tex">k=5</script>, wer‚Äôe working with seeds of
size 12, which would typically be unique in the <em>E. coli</em> reference,
but certainly wouldn‚Äôt be in the human genome, or for metagenomic
applications.</p>

<h3 id="em-rescaling">EM Rescaling</h3>

<p>One limiting factor is the approximate nature of the rescaling so
far that is being performed; for reads that have been basecalled,
the inferred shift values above can be off by several picoamps from
the Metrichor values, which clearly causes both false negatives and
false positives in the index lookup.  This can be addressed by doing
a more careful rescaling step, using EM iterations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the E-step, provisionally assign probabilities of read events
corresponding to model levels, based on the Gaussian distributions 
described in the model and a simple transition matrix between events;</li>
  <li>For the M-step, perform a weighted least squares regression to
re-scale the read levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives answers that are quite good when compared with Metrichor,
at the cost of substantially more computational effort (much greater
than the spatial index lookup!), particularly for long reads and
larger (k) where the number of model levels is larger:</p>

<h3 id="extending-the-seeds">Extending the seeds</h3>

<p>So far we have in no way taken into account any of the locality
information in the spatial index lookup results; that is, that a long
series of hits close together, in the same order on the read and on the
reference, is much stronger evidence for a good mapping than a haphazard
series of hits in random order that happen to fall within the same bin
of starting points.</p>

<p>Keeping with the do-the-simplest-thing approach that has worked so
far, we can try to extend these ‚Äúseed‚Äù matches by stitching them
together into longer seeds; here we build 15-mers out of sets of 4
neighbouring 12-mers, allowing one skip or stay somewhere within
them, using as a score for the result the minimum of the constituent
scores, and dropping all hits that cannot be so extended.  This has
quite modest additional cost, and works quite well:</p>

<p>Now that we seem to have much stronger and more specific results,
we can investigate letting go of binning, and instead string these
extended seeds into longest possible matches.  Continuing to extend
dmer-by-dmer is too challenging due to missing points (due to
mis-calibration, too large noise in the dmer falling out of the
maxdist window in the kdtree, or several skip/stays in a row), so
following the ideas of graphmap<sup id="fnref:1:2"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and minimap<sup id="fnref:5:1"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, we trace
collinear seeds through the set of available seeds; rather than
just taking longest increasing sequences in inferred start positions,
however, we make a graph of seeds with edges connecting  seeds that
are monotonically increasing both in read location and reference
location with ‚Äòsmall enough‚Äô jumps, and extract longest paths through
this graph.  The cost of this is smaller than the rescaling of the read.</p>

<p>Running this, the zscores now somewhat change meaning; only the extracted
paths are scored, meaning that the scores are only amongst plausible
mappings, not over all bins across the reference.  Similarly, the differences
in mapping locations are somewhat more meaningful - rather than being compared
to bin centres, they are actually the differences between mapping locations.</p>

<p>We get:</p>

<p>The simple python testbed implementation of these ideas linked to above
is very slow, single-threaded, absurdly memory hungry, and its treatment
of scores for the mappings does not currently make much sense.  In
the new year we will address these issues in a proper C++ implementation,
where (for instance) we will not have multiple copies of large, reference-sized
data structures.</p>
