<p>This post gives a quick lower-level overview of the steps in the POA
algorithm, with a <a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/poapy">simple implementation in python</a> 
to demonstrate the ideas more concretely.</p>

<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>

<p>The insight of the first POA paper was that ‚Äúflattening‚Äù of
the alignment of sequences leads to meaningless artifacts that, while
largely harmless for pairwise alignments or even multiple alignments
of strongly conserved sequences, causes problems with more general
multiple alignments.  For instance, consider the following sequences:</p>

<pre>
&gt;seq1
CCGCTTTTCCGC
&gt;seq2
CCGCAAAACCGC
</pre>

<p>There is ambiguity in selecting a single, best alignment between
this pair of sequences; for instance below are 4 of</p>
<s>2<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;256</s>
<p>8 choose 4 = 105 nearly equivalent
ways of expressing this pairwise alignment. The best alignment will
depend on the particular gap-scoring scheme used.</p>

<pre>
CCGC----TTTTCGCG   CCGCTTTT----CCGC  CCGC-TT-TT--CGCG   CCGC-T-T-T-TCCGC
CCGCAAAA----CGCG   CCGC----AAAACCGC  CCGCA--A--AACCGC   CCGCA-A-A-A-CCGC
</pre>

<p>While for a pairwise alignment this is comparatively harmless, as
additional sequences are added to form a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA), the choice between these ambiguities begin to distort the eventual
result. What we would like is to consider not necessarily a single linear
layout, but something that can express more unambiguously ‚Äúone
sequence inserts a run of A, and the other of T‚Äù. And a natural way
to view that is with a graph:</p>

<p>The partial order alignment graph differs from the alignment strings
in that a given base can have multiple predecessors (<em>eg</em>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>
after the fork being preceeded by both a string of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>s and of <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code>s)
or successors (<em>eg</em>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> before the fork).  But it is similar to
the alignment strings in that there is a directional order imposed,
both in the sense that each node has (zero or more) predecessors and
(zero or more) successors, but also that no repetition, or doubling
back, is allowed; the graph is constrained to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed, Acyclic
Graph</a> (DAG).</p>

<p>Both repeats and re-orderings can be biologically relevant, and various
generalizations of alignment have allowed this <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.
This greatly generalizes the problem, moving it closer to assembly.
For the purposes of error correction in nanopolish, that additional
generalization is not needed.</p>

<h3 id="smith-waterman">Smith-Waterman</h3>

<p>To consider how alignment to a graph works, let ‚Äôs remind ourselves of
how we perform alignment on sequences.</p>

<p>In the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch</a>
algorithm and its variants, we consider two cursors - one on a base in
each sequence.  For each pair of cursor positions in turn, we consider
the question of ‚Äúwhat is the best sequence of alignments and insertions
that could lead to this position in the alignment‚Äù.  Because the globally
optimal path must be made from locally optimal ‚Äúmoves‚Äù (that is, the
‚Äúprinciple of optimality‚Äù holds for this problem), this reduces to finding
out which of the three possible moves that would advance the cursors to
this position to choose from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both cursors having advanced, aligning (matching) these two bases;</li>
  <li>Cursor 1 had advanced while cursor 2 remained fixed, inserting that base from sequence 1 into the alignment</li>
  <li>Vice versa, with cursor 2 advancing and cursor 1 staying fixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>A familiar diagram follows below; of those three possible moves, we take the
running scores from each of those previous positions, add the score
corresponding to the move, and set the score of the current position.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/poa/sw-dynamicprogramming.png" alt="Dynamic programming for string-string alignment" title="Dynamic programming for string-string alignment" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>We can calculate the scores for pairs of positions in any order we like
‚Äì along rows of the matrix, columns, or minor diagonals ‚Äì
as long as for any position we calculate, the scores for the previous 
positions we need have already been calculated.</p>

<h3 id="string-to-graph-alignment">String to Graph Alignment</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/poa/poa-dynamicprogramming.png" alt="Dynamic programming for graph-string alignment" title="Dynamic programming for graph-string alignment" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Aligning a sequence to a DAG introduces suprisingly little complexity to the
dynamic programming problem; the clever diagram in the POA paper with a dynamic
programming matrix with 3D ‚Äúbumps‚Äù may have had the unintended consequence of
making it look more complicated than it is.</p>

<p>The primary difference for the purposes of dynamic programming is
that while a base in a sequence has exactly one predecessor, a base
in a graph can have two or more.  Thus, the cursor may have come from
one of several previous locations for the same (graph) Insert or Align
moves being considered; and thus those scores must be considered too in
determining the best previous position.  (Note that insertions from the
sequence are unchanged).</p>

<p>So, to reiterate: the only difference deep inside the dynamic programming
loop is that multiple previous scores (and any associated gap-open
information) must be considered for insertions or alignments of the
graph base.  This is implemented by a loop over predecessors for the current
base, and all else remains the same.</p>

<h3 id="topological-sort">Topological Sort</h3>

<p>There is one step that has to happen <em>before</em> that dynamic programming loop,
however.</p>

<p>When aligning two sequences, one could choose an order to loop over the
sequence indices before hand so that, for any new position being calculated,
the necessary previous scores would already be ready.</p>

<p>The nodes in the graph, however, do not have such a useful intrinsic
order.  If the nodes are considered in the order they are added, for
instance, then the newest nodes inserted with a new sequence ‚Äì
which may have been inserted as predecessors of nodes that had been
inserted earlier ‚Äì will not have been already scored when their
successor begins its calculation.</p>

<p>The answer is to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">Topological Sort</a> to generate an
ordering of nodes in which every node is guaranteed to follow all of
its predecessors.  This is always possible for a directed graph as long
as there are no cycles, and indeed there can be many such orderings.
Topological sorts are how <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> and similar tools decide in which order 
to perform tasks in a workflow, and how many<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> spreadsheet programs decide 
if cells need to be updated.</p>

<p>There are two main classes of algorithms for performing topological sorts; the
algorithm of Kahn (1962), and a repeated depth-first search.  Either serves
perfectly well for the dynamic programming problem.</p>

<p>So to align a sequence to a graph, the steps are simply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perform a topological sort if the graph has been updated</li>
  <li>Do the dynamic programming step as usual, with:
    <ul>
      <li>The graph nodes visited in the order of the topological sort, and</li>
      <li>Considering all valid predecessors for align/insert moves.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="insertion-of-aligned-sequence">Insertion of aligned sequence</h3>

<p>Consider that we have a graph that so far only contains the sequence <code class="highlighter-rouge">CGCTTAT</code>,
and our dynamic programming calculation aligning the sequence <code class="highlighter-rouge">CGATTACG</code> has
given us an alignment that looks like this:</p>

<pre>
CGATTACG
||.|||.
CGCTTAT-
</pre>

<p>That is, for each base in the sequence, it is paired (either as match or
mismatch) with a base in the graph, or it is inserted.</p>

<p>We expect inserting the new sequence into the graph to give us something like:</p>

<div id="mynetwork2"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  // create a network
var nodes = [
    {id:0, label: "C", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 0, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true }, {id:1, label: "G", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 150, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true },
    {id:8, label: "C", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 300, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true }, {id:2, label: "A"},
    {id:3, label: "T", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 450, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true }, {id:4, label: "T", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 600, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true },
    {id:5, label: "A", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 750, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true }, {id:9, label: "T"},
    {id:6, label: "C", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 900, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true }, {id:7, label: "G", allowedToMoveX: false, x: 1050, y: 0 , allowedToMoveY: true }
];
 
var edges = [
    {from: 0, to: 1, value: 3}, {from: 1, to: 8, value: 2}, {from: 1, to: 2, value: 2},
    {from: 8, to: 3, value: 2}, {from: 2, to: 3, value: 2}, {from: 2, to: 8, value: 1, style: "dash-line"},
    {from: 3, to: 4, value: 3}, {from: 4, to: 5, value: 3}, {from: 5, to: 9, value: 2},
    {from: 5, to: 6, value: 2}, {from: 6, to: 7, value: 2}, {from: 6, to: 9, value: 1, style: "dash-line"}
];

  var container = document.getElementById('mynetwork2');
  var data= { nodes: nodes, edges: edges, };
  var options = { width: '100%', height: '200px' };
  var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>

<p>Here we see for the first time two types of edges; bold, directed edges
(with directions not shown, but left-to-right), indicating
predecessor/successor; and dashed lines, indicating that (say) the <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>
that are three bases from the start are aligned to each other, but are
mismatches; similarly with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> towards the end.</p>

<p>We keep track of both the predecessor/successor nodes and all ‚Äòaligned-to‚Äô
nodes.  We walk along the sequence we are inserting and its calculated
alignment.  We insert nodes in the sequence if they are not aligned to
anything, or none of the nodes that it directly or indirectly aligns to have
the same base; otherwise, we re-use that node and simply add new edges to it if
necessary.</p>

<p>In more detail, the steps we take are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new ‚Äústarting point‚Äù for this sequence is created in the graph.</li>
  <li>The previous position is set to this starting point.</li>
  <li>For each sequence base in the calculated alignment,
    <ul>
      <li>If the current base is not aligned to a node in the graph, or if it is but neither the node nor any node <em>it</em> is aligned to has the same base,
        <ul>
          <li>A new node is created with the sequence base, and is selected as the current node</li>
          <li>This new node is aligned to the aligned node if any, and all of the ‚Äúaligned-to‚Äù nodes are updated to align to this one.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise,
        <ul>
          <li>That node with the same base is selected as the current node</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If one does not already exist, a new edge is added from the previous position to the current node</li>
      <li>That edge has the current sequence label added to it; the number of labels on the edge correspond to the number of sequences that include that edge and those two nodes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Fusing nodes whenever possible ensures that information about a motif that
several times in several sequences in a similar location is not obscured
by corresponding to several paths through the graph; It also increases
the runtime of the algorithm by limiting the number of nodes and edges that
need to be considered.</p>

<p>Note that one can always reconstruct any individual sequence inserted into the
graph by looking up its starting point, and following edges labelled with the
corresponding label through the graph.</p>

<p>Once an aligned sequence is inserted, a new topological sort of the nodes is
generated, and another alignment can be perfomed.</p>

<h3 id="consensus-paths">Consensus paths</h3>

<p>Now that you have all of your sequences in the graph, how do you get things
like a consensus sequence out of it?  This is the topic of a paper<sup id="fnref:2:1"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> separate
from the first one.</p>

<p>Finding the single best-supported traversal through the graph is relatively
straightforward.  In fact, this is again a dynamic programming problem; one
sets the scores of all nodes to zero, and then marches through the graph node
by node.  At each node, one chooses the ‚Äúbest‚Äù edge into that node ‚Äì the
one with the most sequences including it ‚Äì and sets the score to be 
the edge weight plus the score of the node pointed to; and in case of a tie
between edges, one chooses the one pointing to the highest-scoring node.</p>

<p>The highest score and the edges chosen gives you a maximum-weighted path
through the graph.  As is pointed out in the consensus paper, this is
a maximum-likelihood path if the edge weights correspond to the probabilities
that the edge is followed.</p>

<p>However, there may well be multiple consensus features in the alignment that
one wishes to extract; a feature seen by multiple but still a minority of
sequences.  The approach to finding remaining consenses is necessarily somewhat
heuristic, and comprises the bulk of the consensus paper.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to somehow remove or downweight the edges that
correspond to the already-extracted consenses, and repeat the procedure
to find additional features.  The steps recommended in the consensus paper are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify sequences that correspond to the consensus just identified; by (<em>eg</em>) fraction of their bases/edges included, possibly with other requirements</li>
  <li>For edges corresponding to those sequences, reduce the weight corresponding to those sequences, possibly to zero</li>
  <li>Rerun the consensus algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the simple implementation we use to demonstrate these ideas, we simply
choose all (remaining) sequences that have a majority of their bases
represented in the current consensus sequence, remove the corresponding weight
of those edges entirely, and repeat until no further sequences remain or no
significant consensus sequence is found.</p>

<p>The consensus paper identifies a particular corner case where a consensus
sequence might terminate early; we allow this to happen.</p>

<h3 id="alignment-strings">Alignment strings</h3>

<p>Finally, to communicate the alignment results, it can still be useful
to generate a ‚Äúflattened‚Äù alignment of the input and consensus sequences.</p>

<p>This is again fairly straightforwardly done once the graph is topologically
sorted.  Each node in the graph, in topological order, is assigned a column
in the final table to be generated, with rings of nodes that are aligned to
each other assigned to the same column, and nodes that are not aligned to any
others getting their own column. Then the bases are filled in, with each 
sequence (including the consensus sequences) getting their own row.</p>

<p>Because we are assigning columns to the nodes in topologically-sorted order,
the method used to generate the (non-unique) topological sort affects how
the alignments look as alignment strings, even if they are all functionally
identical.  Kahn sorting tends to interleave the results of sequences, whereas
depth-first-search necessarily visits long strings of runs in order.  DFS
then generates better looking alignment strings, so we use that approach
in the implementation below.</p>

<h3 id="simple-implementation">Simple Implementation</h3>

<p>A simple but fully functional Python implementation of the algorithms
described above <a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/poapy">can be found here</a>.
For the alignment stage, two implementations are given; one
that is quite simple to follow but is very slow; and another
that is significantly faster, but may require a little more careful
reading, as it uses numpy vectorization to improve performance.</p>

<p>Even the faster implementation is still slow ‚Äì about 10 times slower
than the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/poamsa/">poaV2</a> code written
in C as distributed, or closer to 20 if poaV2 is compiled with <code class="highlighter-rouge">-O3</code>
‚Äì but is nonetheless useable for small problems.</p>

<p>The simple implementation above can generate HTML with an interactive
graph visualization to explore the final partial order graph; the
visualization works particularly well on browsers with a high-performance
javascript implementation, but stops being useful for graphs with more
than a thousand nodes or so.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Partial order alignment is a powerful technique that results in a
graph containing rich information concerning the structure of the
aligned sequences, but lacks the amount of online documentation and
easy-to-explore implementations of some other methods; we hope this
helps introduce a broader audience to a more in-depth understanding
of the method.</p>
