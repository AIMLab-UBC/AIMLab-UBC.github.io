                    <h3>Learning generalizable AI models for multi-center histopathology image classification
</h3>
                    <p>Histopathology—the study of tissue samples under a microscope—is a key method for diagnosing cancer. Pathologists examine slides to identify cancerous cells, but the process is time-consuming and prone to variability, especially with differences in tissue preparation and slide staining.</p>

                    <p>This research focuses on improving the classification of endometrial cancer (EC), a cancer that affects the lining of the uterus. Endometrial Cancer (EC) has four molecular subtypes, each with different implications for prognosis and treatment. </p>
