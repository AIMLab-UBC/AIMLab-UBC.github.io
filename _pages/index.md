The Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Lab research area lies the interface between computational, engineering and biomedical sciences.

We are interested in developing machine learning, statistical and signal processing algorithms and software infrastructure to combine various sources of omics and imaging data with major emphasis on discovering novel complex biological information related to different diseases.

We are specifically focused on gynaecological and breast cancers as well as lymphoid malignancies and how these cancers evolve and respond to therapies.
