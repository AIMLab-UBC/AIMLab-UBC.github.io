# Openings

Please contact me if you are interested in graduate research assistant or post-doctoral positions in the following areas: Machine learning applications in medical imaging and genomics, Bioinformatics (Computational Biology), Computational Pathology, Computational Genomics

I look for individuals with strong analytical as well as programming skills. Therefore, if you have taken courses related to machine learning and programming, there is a high likelihood that I am interested to know more about you.

Please include your CV (including details of the projects that you have worked on and link to your code repository) and transcripts (for PhD and MSc candidates) in your correspondence.

Note 1: I admit graduate students through the [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.ubc.ca/), the [Graduate Program in Bioinformatics](http://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/), and the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine. In special cases, I may admit students through the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department.
